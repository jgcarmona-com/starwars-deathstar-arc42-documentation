- **Command and Control**: The central hub responsible for coordinating all Death Star operations and strategic decisions.  
  [See more](./05_building_block_view.md#command-and-control)

- **Communication Partners**: External entities, systems, or users that interact with the Death Star.  
  [See more](./03_context_and_scope.md#communication-partners)

- **Crosscutting Concepts**: Technical principles that impact multiple components within the system to ensure consistency and efficiency.  
  [See more](./08_crosscutting_concepts.md#crosscutting-concepts)
