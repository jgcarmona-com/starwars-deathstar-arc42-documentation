# 4. Solution Strategy

## Overview

This section provides an outline of the fundamental decisions and strategies that shape the Death Star's architecture. These are the guiding principles that influence the design and operational behavior of the system.

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Technology Stack**: The Death Star uses a proprietary mix of high-energy reactors, advanced AI, and a distributed control system to manage and operate all essential functions.
2. **Modular Design**: The system is designed with a modular approach, separating weaponry, power generation, and life-support systems. This enhances maintainability and resilience.
3. **Top-Level Decomposition**: The architecture follows a layered pattern, isolating critical subsystems, such as reactor controls and weapon systems, to ensure they operate independently from secondary functions.
4. **Security and Access Control**: High-security protocols are in place to limit access to critical systems, reducing the risk of sabotage or unauthorized modifications.

## Motivation

These decisions establish the foundation for the Death Star's operational capabilities. By setting clear guidelines around technology, design patterns, and access protocols, the architecture minimizes risks and supports the long-term goals of the Galactic Empire.

## Form

The strategies and decisions are documented to serve as a reference for all subsequent architectural choices, supporting the overall quality and robustness of the Death Star's systems. Each decision is made based on the system's primary objectives and constraints, providing a clear rationale for the approach taken.
