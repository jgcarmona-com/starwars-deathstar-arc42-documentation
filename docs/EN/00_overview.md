# Death Star Architecture - arc42 Overview

## Introduction

This documentation provides a fictional example of how to document the architecture of a complex system like the Death Star, using the **arc42** template. The arc42 model structures architectural documentation into key sections, making it easier to communicate complex systems' design decisions, structures, and requirements.

## Purpose of This Example

Through this fictional case study, we aim to:
- Illustrate how each section of arc42 can be applied to an advanced system.
- Offer an educational tool for software architects and Star Wars fans.
- Demonstrate the importance of structured documentation for identifying risks and ensuring quality.

## Contents

1. [**Introduction and Goals**](01_introduction_and_goals.md) - Defining the purpose, stakeholders, and main objectives of the Death Star project.
2. [**Constraints**](02_constraints.md) - Highlighting external and internal restrictions that shape the architecture.
3. [**Context and Scope**](03_context_and_scope.md) - Delimiting the Death Starâ€™s scope, interactions, and dependencies with external systems.
4. [**Solution Strategy**](04_solution_strategy.md) - Core strategies and high-level decisions for the Death Star's design.
5. [**Building Block View**](05_building_block_view.md) - Structural components and their organization.
6. [**Runtime View**](06_runtime_view.md) - Behavior and interactions of the components in key scenarios.
7. [**Deployment View**](07_deployment_view.md) - Infrastructure and distribution of components across environments.
8. [**Crosscutting Concepts**](08_crosscutting_concepts.md) - Technical concepts that apply to multiple parts of the system.
9. [**Architectural Decisions**](09_architectural_decisions.md) - Key architectural decisions and their motivations.
