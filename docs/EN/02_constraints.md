# 2. Constraints

## Overview

This section outlines the constraints that affect the design and development of the Death Star architecture. Constraints include both external factors, such as political or legal mandates from the Galactic Empire, and internal factors, such as technological limitations or specific design requirements.

## External Constraints

- **Imperial Security Mandates**: All design elements must comply with strict security protocols to prevent unauthorized access, especially by Rebel spies.
- **Operational Secrecy**: The project is classified as top-secret, limiting the number of personnel who can be involved and access specific design details.
- **Budgetary and Resource Limitations**: Although substantial, resources are not infinite. Allocation decisions must prioritize critical features.

## Internal Constraints

- **Technological Limitations**: The reactor design must be large enough to generate immense power, which imposes limitations on structure and layout.
- **Standardization**: The Death Starâ€™s architecture must adhere to Imperial design standards to facilitate maintenance and upgrades.
- **Risk of Catastrophic Failure**: Due to the scale of the weapon, any design flaw could lead to catastrophic outcomes, requiring extreme caution in all design decisions.

These constraints define the framework within which all architectural decisions for the Death Star are made, ensuring alignment with Imperial standards and operational needs.
