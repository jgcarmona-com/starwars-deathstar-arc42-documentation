# 3. Context and Scope

## Overview

This section defines the boundaries of the Death Star system, identifying its external communication partners and interfaces. It distinguishes between the business context (domain-specific interactions) and the technical context (communication protocols, channels, hardware).

## Business Context

The Death Star interacts with multiple external systems and entities, each fulfilling a unique role. These include:
- **Imperial Command**: Provides mission objectives, tactical decisions, and security protocols.
- **Fleet and Ground Troops**: Coordinate for operational support, logistics, and deployment of resources.
- **Planetary Governors**: Interfaces for jurisdictional authority, surveillance, and control.

## Technical Context

The technical context focuses on the interfaces, protocols, and communication channels necessary for the Death Star to interact with its environment. This includes:
- **Data Transmission**: Secure channels for command and control from Imperial Command.
- **Weapon Systems**: Interfaces for targeting, power distribution, and firing control.
- **Sensor Arrays**: Continuous monitoring of surrounding space and planetary bodies.

## Motivation

Understanding the business and technical context ensures that all external dependencies are managed, and the Death Starâ€™s interactions with other systems are seamless. Proper documentation of these interfaces is critical to avoid miscommunication or failure in high-stakes situations.
