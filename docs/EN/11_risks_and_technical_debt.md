# 11. Risks and Technical Debt

## Overview

This section outlines known risks and technical debt within the Death Star architecture. Identifying and documenting these risks enables proactive planning to mitigate potential issues that could impact the system’s long-term performance, security, and reliability.

## Key Risks

1. **Reactor Core Vulnerability**
   - **Description**: The single central reactor, while efficient, presents a **single point of failure**. An attack targeting this area could lead to catastrophic outcomes.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement enhanced shielding and compartmentalization around the reactor core to protect against direct strikes.

2. **Potential for Unauthorized Access**
   - **Description**: The complexity of the Death Star’s security protocols may contain overlooked vulnerabilities, which could be exploited by skilled intruders.
   - **Mitigation**: Conduct regular security audits and enhance monitoring to detect any suspicious activity promptly.

3. **System Overload During High-Energy Operations**
   - **Description**: Simultaneous operation of high-energy components, such as the superlaser and shield generators, could overload the power distribution system.
   - **Mitigation**: Establish a power management protocol that prioritizes energy allocation to mission-critical systems.

4. **Data Synchronization and Consistency Issues**
   - **Description**: With multiple subsystems operating simultaneously, data synchronization challenges could lead to discrepancies that impact decision-making.
   - **Mitigation**: Regularly test data synchronization protocols and employ redundancy mechanisms to ensure data integrity across systems.

## Technical Debt

1. **Legacy Components**: Some subsystems are based on older technology, complicating integration with newer modules and potentially impacting performance.
2. **Documentation Gaps**: Incomplete documentation in certain areas makes system updates and troubleshooting more challenging for engineering teams.
3. **Inflexible Architecture**: The rigid structure of some modules limits the ability to modify or expand certain capabilities without major redesigns.

## Motivation

Documenting risks and technical debt ensures that known challenges are visible to all stakeholders. By addressing these issues proactively, the Death Star’s architecture can be better prepared to maintain reliability, security, and adaptability in future missions.
