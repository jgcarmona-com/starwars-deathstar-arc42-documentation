# 10. Quality Requirements

## Overview

This section outlines the primary quality requirements for the Death Starâ€™s architecture, focusing on the performance, security, and reliability metrics that are essential for its operation. The following quality goals and scenarios serve as benchmarks to guide architectural decisions and system improvements.

## Quality Goals

1. **High Operational Reliability**: The Death Star must function seamlessly without interruptions during missions, ensuring continuous availability of critical systems.
2. **Enhanced Security**: Prevent unauthorized access to core systems and safeguard sensitive data from Rebel interception.
3. **Efficient Power Usage**: Minimize energy waste to support extended missions and prevent overheating during high-energy operations.
4. **Scalability**: Allow modular upgrades, especially for weaponry and defense systems, to adapt to future needs and technologies.

## Quality Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Reactor Stability During Extended Operation
   - **Trigger**: Continuous operation of the reactor for over 24 hours during a mission.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The cooling system manages temperature effectively, and the reactor maintains stable output without failure.
   - **Metric**: Reactor operates within safe temperature limits, ensuring system reliability.

### Scenario 2: Defense Against Unauthorized Access
   - **Trigger**: Attempted unauthorized access to critical systems.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Access is denied, an alert is sent to Command and Control, and the intruder is logged and monitored.
   - **Metric**: 100% detection rate of unauthorized access attempts, with real-time alerts.

### Scenario 3: Power Management Under High Load
   - **Trigger**: Activation of multiple high-energy systems, including the superlaser and shield generators.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Power distribution is balanced, with priority given to mission-critical systems.
   - **Metric**: Energy usage remains within operational thresholds, avoiding any system overloads.
