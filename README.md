Welcome to the **Star Wars Death Star arc42 Documentation** repository! This project aims to document the fictional architecture of the **Death Star** by applying the **arc42 model**, a popular framework for structured software architecture documentation. Inspired by the Star Wars universe, this project provides an educational example of applying arc42 to a complex system, exploring each section in detail.

## Overview

This repository is organized into two main sections:
- **[English Documentation](docs/EN)** (`docs/EN`): Contains all arc42 sections in English.
- **[Spanish Documentation](docs/ES)** (`docs/ES`): Contains all arc42 sections in Spanish.

## About arc42

arc42 is a standardized template for documenting software architectures. Developed by software architects for practical, structured documentation, arc42 is widely used for complex systems. This repository uses the Death Star as a fictional case study to demonstrate each arc42 section in practice.

May the documentation be with you!
